## Hi there ðŸ‘‹,

I am a senior software engineer currently living in Spain ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸, with a passion for Go, DevOps, Terraform and Security.
I like to think of myself as the Swiss Army Knife of software engineering - I may not be the best at everything, but
I'm pretty darn good at a lot of things. And when it comes to developer experience, I am all about making life easier
for my fellow engineers. I am always up for a challenge and am always looking for ways to improve myself and the
projects I work on.


## ðŸ“¬ Get in touch
